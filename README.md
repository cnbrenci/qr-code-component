## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My first application of CSS Grid on a project outside of codecademy tutorials. Found multiple ways to layout the figure element so it shows in the center of the page using Grid and Flexbox.  

If not set, height of the grid is going to conform to the size of the content inside. In order to get the space above and below to fill the browser height, needed to set the height of the grid container to 100vh.

Also learned a bit about how to nagivate and understand what's going on in figma!

### Continued development

More practice needed with Grid and Flexbox. I also wasn't really thinking about how re-usable this component would be; I was only really thinking about how to match the design given that this is the only thing on the page. Need to think a bit more / learn more about portability and best practices.

### Useful resources

MDN docs always coming in clutch. Also, looking back over codecademy lessons was helpful.

## Acknowledgments

Parallel programmed*** the project with mlooper5! Thanks for teaching me figma things and figuring out how to fix the 3x3 grid layout!

***: I'm calling it parallel programming, as opposed to pair programming, because we are both working through implementing the same spec but in our own projects. This gives us an opportunity to experiment freely and in parallel when trying to figure something out, discuss what we are learning, make different implementation decisions, and compare and contrast our results.
